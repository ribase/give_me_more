  send_general_to_swiss_army_school_desc:0 "Swiss mercenaries (Reisläufer) were notable for their service in foreign armies, especially the armies of the Kings of France, throughout the Early Modern period of European history, from the Later Middle Ages into the Age of the European Enlightenment. Their service as mercenaries was at its peak during the Renaissance, when their proven battlefield capabilities made them sought-after mercenary troops. There followed a period of decline, as technological and organizational advances counteracted the Swiss' advantages. Switzerland's military isolationism largely put an end to organized mercenary activity; the principal remnant of the practice is the Pontifical Swiss Guard at the Vatican."

  advance_country_with_gold_desc:0 "Gold was used in commerce (beside other precious metals) in the Ancient Near East since the Bronze Age, but coins proper originated much later, during the 6th century BC, in Anatolia. The name of king Croesus of Lydia remains associated with the invention (although the Parian Chronicle mentions Pheidon of Argos as a contender). In 546 BC, Croesus was captured by the Persians, who adopted gold as the main metal for their coins. The most valuable of all Persian minted coinage still remains the gold drahms, minted in 1 AD as a gift by the Persian King Vonones Hebrew Bible new testament (Matthew 2.1–23).[1][2] Ancient Greek coinage contained a number of gold coins issued by the various city states."

  throw_money_from_the_window_desc:0 "Its basically the fault of the Renaissance and Enlightenment. Writers and artists at the time wanted to seem more advanced so they painted the previous eras as backwards and decrepit. It was made even worse because there was so much looking back at the classical civilizations, especially Rome. Since the Dark Ages & Middle Ages were after the fall of the Western Empire there were assumed to be terrible places. Things like the Carolingian Renaissance were largely ignored. This stigma lasted well into modern times, although the recent trend in history is to give credit to the Middle Ages for the accomplishments that did occur."
  spend_into_my_country_desc:0 "Build some monumental buildings in your country and pass over all proposals to show domination of the masses. By agree with the terms and conditions, your country will slide into corruption and you have to scapegoat one of your advisors."
  buy_in_military_knowledge_desc:0 "New weapons development can dramatically alter the face of war, the cost of warfare, the preparations, and the training of soldiers and leaders.
